# See The Girl: The Policy Center - DataDive Event 

This a work done as part of the DataDive Event, September 17-18, 2021, Shining a light on community to advance a nation. On this day, project managers, co-volunteers and volunteers (like me) gathered to discuss, understand and publish information with the purpose of helping the Policy Center to extract easily information about the correlated variables and their impact in education, economics and arrests at Florida Counties.

Here, I dived into some of the datasets to better understand them and be able to deliver a map with correlated information about arrests and disciplined students. You'll be able to see a entity relationship diagram (ERD) to help you navigate to the tables and what they became.

Unfortunately, I couldn't publish the report on web, because of the administrative or pro limitation, but feel free to download the power bi report at any time. 

The work done on this saturday was:

* Studied the datasets.
* Identified the correlated data in most of the sheets.
* Separated and grouped the dimension information of Discipline, County and Ethnic Group.
* Added the Latitude and Longitude information from the [opendatasoft website](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-county-boundaries).
* Plotted some variables into visuals and correlated arrests, commitments, ethnicity and school disciplines.

As a result of this work, you'll be able to see that the majority of the girls arrests in all the counties are originated from black ethnic group (2019-2020 dataset) and that the counties with bigger percentage of school disciplines are also the ones in the top of the black arrests and commitments (dataset 2018-2019). But there's a lot of analysis in need to get the assertive results.
